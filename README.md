# OFPP

This is a library of pseudopotentials (PPs) for Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory (OF-DFT).

## Download

	git clone --recurse-submodules https://gitlab.com/shaoxc/ofpp.git

## Pseudopotentials

### EAC (BLPS and goLPS)

Bulk local pseudopotentials (BLPSs) and globally-optimized local pseudopotentials (goLPSs) are generated by [Carter group](https://carter.princeton.edu)

### OEPP

Optimized effective pseudopotentials (OEPPs) are generated by [ATLAS developers group](http://atlas-ch.cn)


### NLPP

Pseudopotentials for transition metal elements based on GBRV and PSL by [PRG](https://sites.rutgers.edu/prg/)


### DFT-MUEC

The transferable pseudopotentials are developed for H, Li, and Al in WDM conditions by [Density Functional Theory for Matter under Extreme Conditions](https://ofdft.phys.ufl.edu/)
